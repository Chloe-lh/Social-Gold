**User-Profiles**: abiltity to host multiple authors on different nodes
**Posting Entries**: Users can create plain text or CommonMark entries. Images are also supported
**Sharing**: Entries, likes, comments, and follow requests are pushed to remote nodes via inboxing
**Following/Friends**: Ability to follow local/remote users with visibility flags
**Node Management**: Node admins can add, modift, and delete authors. Node to node connections are authenticated with HTTP Basic Auth. We employed RESTful API to assist with cross-domain interoperability with other nodes.
